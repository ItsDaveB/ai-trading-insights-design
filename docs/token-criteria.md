# AI Trading Insights Token Criteria

### Criteria for Acceptable Tokens

This document outlines the criteria for determining acceptable tokens for inclusion. The primary measure is the token's trading volume over the last 24 hours, specifically denominated in ADA. Tokens will be ranked in descending order based on this volume. Initially, the focus will be on the top 15 tokens, though this parameter is fully configurable to adapt to future requirements.

### Default Launch Configuration

- **Volume Metric:** ADA trading volume in the last 24 hours
- **Sorting Order:** Descending (highest to lowest volume)
- **Token Count:** Top 15 tokens by volume
- **Customizability:** The number of tokens and ranking parameters can be adjusted as needed.

This approach ensures that newly launched, high-profile tokens can achieve visibility in the rankings as they gain significant trading volume, delivering direct value to tokens in demand. It is designed to adapt to fast-moving and relevant market data, ensuring responsiveness to changing trends. As the project evolves, these criteria will be continually refined to align with ongoing learnings and market dynamics.

Additionally, the system will be coded to allow specified tokens to be included manually, bypassing the standard criteria. This ensures flexibility to accommodate partnerships, promotional activities, or strategic initiatives without requiring tokens to meet the default thresholds.
