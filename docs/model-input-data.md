# AI Trading Insights Model Input Data

## Data Requirements for Cardano Tokens

To develop actionable AI-driven trading insights for Cardano tokens, it is essential to gather and preprocess specific datasets. This document provides a detailed breakdown of the core data requirements, ensuring that the selected defaults are sufficient for key indicators while allowing flexibility for configuration and expansion. The focus is on using effective data that supports robust analysis, including standard indicator analysis.

## Data Requirements

### 1. **Cardano Market Data**

- **OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) Data**:
  - **Default Timeframe**: 4-hour candles over the past 21 days.
    - This configuration balances granularity and data efficiency, offering 126 data points that are ideal for most trading indicators and strategies.
  - **Configurable Options**:
    - Additional timeframes such as daily, weekly, 1-hour, or 15-minute candles can be used based on specific use cases and requirements.
  - **Fields**:
    - `timestamp`
    - `open`
    - `high`
    - `low`
    - `close`
    - `volume` (optional but beneficial)

## Data Source and Integration

- The data will be provided by the application's **datasource** once integrated to ensure consistency with the current chart implementation. This guarantees that the data used for analysis is identical to the data powering the charts, preventing discrepancies.
- **Optional External API Support**:
  - If the application's current datasource is missing specific data points, external APIs such as **TapTools** can be utilized to supplement or complete the data requirements.
  - This ensures flexibility during implementation and demonstration while maintaining high-quality, reliable data inputs.
  - Utilizing real data from these sources ensures the proposal can be completed effectively and delivers **real value** by providing actionable, accurate insights.

## Benefits of Using This Input Data

1. **Improved Trading Accuracy**:

   - Using 4-hour candles over a 21-day period allows AI models to identify meaningful price trends and momentum shifts while reducing market noise.
   - Daily and weekly data enable longer-term trend analysis, supporting swing and positional traders.
   - Configurable, granular timeframes (e.g., 15-minute, 1-hour) can be employed for detecting short-term price movements critical for scalping and intraday strategies.

2. **Enhanced Predictive Modeling**:

   - The OHLC data forms the backbone of predictive models, helping to forecast future price movements based on historical patterns.
   - The 4-hour timeframe strikes a balance between short-term and medium-term trends, making it versatile for various trading strategies.

3. **Risk Management**:

   - Volume data, while **beneficial but not required**, provides insights into market liquidity, helping assess the ease of entering or exiting positions without slippage.
   - Low-volume zones can serve as indicators of potential manipulation or illiquid trading conditions.

4. **Market Sentiment and Momentum**:

   - The highs and lows from 4-hour candles provide key insights into intraday volatility and overall market sentiment.
   - Configurable timeframes (e.g., daily, 1-hour) allow for a deeper understanding of sentiment shifts across different trading windows.

5. **Cross-Timeframe Analysis**:

   - Combining 4-hour candles with other timeframes (e.g., daily, weekly, 1-hour) allows for effective multi-timeframe analysis, which can validate trends and pinpoint key price levels.
   - This approach increases trader confidence and supports a more comprehensive view of market dynamics.

6. **Foundation for Advanced Metrics and Standard Indicator Analysis**:
   - The preprocessed OHLC and optional volume data can be used to calculate advanced indicators such as:
     - Moving Averages
     - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
     - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
     - Bollinger Bands
     - ATR (Average True Range)
   - Additionally, this data allows for **standard technical analysis**, including:
     - Identification of **support and resistance levels**.
     - Spotting **price breakouts** and **trend reversals**.
     - Calculating **pivot points** for key price zones.
     - Analyzing **volatility** and its impact on trade opportunities.
   - The default 4-hour data ensures these metrics and insights are calculated efficiently and accurately, with flexibility for alternative configurations if needed.

## Configurability

While the default configuration (4-hour candles, 21 days) is optimized for most indicators and trading strategies, the system is flexible and can accommodate:

- **Shorter timeframes** (e.g., 15-minute or 1-hour candles) for high-frequency or intraday trading strategies.
- **Longer timeframes** (e.g., daily, weekly) for swing trading or long-term trend analysis.
- **Extended data periods** for backtesting or capturing broader historical trends.

**Note**: Volume data is optional and not required, but it can significantly enhance insights by supporting liquidity analysis, breakout detection, and validation of technical patterns. Even without volume data, the system can deliver actionable outputs.

This configurability ensures that the data collection and analysis process can adapt to various trading styles, objectives, and evolving needs, while remaining efficient and extensible for future enhancements.
